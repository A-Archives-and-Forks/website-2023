      "Our company attaches great importance to ecological collaboration and skill sharing around open source software: in recent years, our company has also arranged contributors to participate in open source project promotion activities at home and abroad as mentors every year, such as the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (hereinafter omitted: Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences) The \"Open Source Summer\" activity leads domestic and foreign college students to exercise application and research and development capabilities and accumulate professional experience.",
      "In addition to the above activities, many of our projects are maintained and managed by contributors on a voluntary basis. Many projects in the community not only have direct and close connections with other communities and even upstream projects, but also have a certain reputation in the industry. Over the past few years, many contributors have honed their technical skills and accumulated personal experience by participating in community projects and management, and have fully demonstrated the positive significance of these experiences when employed.",
