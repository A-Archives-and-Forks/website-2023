Since the establishment of the community many years ago, our community has attached great importance to the localization of project interfaces and documents. At the same time, it has long been engaged in the localization work of upstream projects such as GNOME, KDE, CUPS, and Wine to improve the use experience of various software for Simplified Chinese.",
    "p2": "While promoting these tasks, we are also responsible for editing and maintaining the localization work specification document \"Mainland Simplified Chinese Free Software Localization Work Guide\" to guide colleagues from all walks of life to promote localization work correctly and efficiently. In addition, starting in 2020, we have also released internship projects for localization work through the \"Open Source Summer\" of the Institute of Software of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, attracting new people from all walks of life to participate in our company's localization work.",
