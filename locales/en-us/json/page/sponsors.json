While reducing project development and maintenance costs and improving work experience, it also allows users of various projects in the community to enjoy the best possible service quality. The strong support of sponsors allows the Antong open source community to survive and develop while maintaining the basic principles of independent operation and volunteer drive. We here display the various sponsoring units and individuals in the community today and in history, and would like to express our sincerity of gratitude."
